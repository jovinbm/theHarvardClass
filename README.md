============

This was my CS50 final Project.I'm still maintaining this project. The project implements Node.js event mechanism, to create conversational rooms where people can ask questions. It also includes an upvote mechanism to help a teacher/professor answer the top upvoted questions. Nevertheless, the idea can also be used in different environments that require individual anonymous chat rooms.
